Why, hello there!

I've seem to have stumbled upon an area or interest (at least for now) in the TikTok community.  That area happens to be one of my favorite tools: PowerShell!

Here are some video I've recorded so far:

Part 1: The goal for this video was honestly to show off the "CLIP" command and everything preceding it was completely ad-libbed.  It turns out a lot of people were interested in seeing more!

Part 2: I specifically cover Aliasing in PowerShell to address some comments that spoke to the verbosity of the tool.

If you are reading this and want to see anything specifically covered within PowerShell; please feel free to leave a comment on the Youtube video.  I'll do my best to cover everything that I am familiar with and can.

Thanks!

( P.S. I'll eventually spend some time on proper video thumbnails. :-) )
