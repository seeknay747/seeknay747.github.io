# About Me

Hello! I'm Pat, a passionate Information Technology professional with a keen focus on Identity. With 10+ years of experience in technologies and platforms such as Active Directory, Okta, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Exchange, and a few others.  I also work like to work on projects that involve Identity Governance, User Lifecycle Management, Mergers & Acquisitions, and Migrations. I am very passionate about providing secure and efficient identity solutions.

## Purpose for the Blog

This blog serves as a platform to showcase my ongoing interests, share insights, and document my learning journey in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

## Personal Interests

What you can catch me doing when not working on Technology projects:

- **Posting on TikTok**: I started a small channel for fun posting Career/TechTok content and it's been a great public speaking excersie.  Plus, i've met some great creators along the way and learned a lot in the process!
- **Playing PC Games**: My current go-to games are HellDivers 2 and Diablo 4 (when I can get time to play).
- **Brewing Coffee/Espresso**: A few years back, I picked up the hobby of pour-over Coffee and Espresso brewing.
- **Watching Star Trek**: I'm a huge Star Trek fan. [TNG > Voyager > DS9 > Picard > TOS > Discovery]
